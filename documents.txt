Pow er of 8 What is a Pip?

### Section: Beginners Crash Course – Page 40
A pip = “percentage in point”
It measures the smallest movement in currency price
Usually the 4th decimal place (0.0001)
Example: EUR/USD moves from 1.1000 → 1.1001 = 1 pip
Pow er of 8

### Section: Beginners Crash Course – Page 41
For JPY pairs, a pip = 2nd decimal place (0.01)
Example: USD/JPY moves from 145.00 → 145.01 = 1 pip
Pow er of 8 Exceptions

### Section: Beginners Crash Course – Page 42
Pip value = how much money 1 pip movement equals
Depends on:
Pair traded
Lot size (0.01, 0.1, 1.0)

The universal unit of risk & reward

### Section: Beginners Crash Course – Page 47
R = your risk per trade (the amount you are willing to lose)
Every trade = measured in multiples of R (not dollars)
Example: If you risk $100 = 1R → win 2R = $200 profit
Pow er of 8 Simple Definition

### Section: Beginners Crash Course – Page 48
Normalizes performance → doesn’t matter if account is $1k or $100k

Pow er of 8Why R Matters

Ratio of how much you risk vs aim to make
Example:
SL = 1R ($100)
TP = 2R ($200) → R:R = 1:2

 Protect your capital above all else

### Section: Week 4 – Page 2

Pow er of 8Fixed % Risk vs Fixed Lot Size
Two approaches to risk — pick what fits your system

### Section: Week 4 – Page 10
Pow er of 8Risk = % of account (e.g., 1%)
Lot size changes depending on stoploss distance
✅ Pros: keeps % risk consistentFixed % Risk Per Trade
❌ Cons: constantly adjusting size → can confuse beginners

### Section: Week 4 – Page 11
Pow er of 8Same lot size every trade
R:R remains consistent because stoploss distance is stable
✅ Pros: simpler, easier to track data Fixed Lot Size MY CHOICE
❌ Cons: only works if your stoploss ranges are similar

### Section: Week 4 – Page 12
Pow er of 8My stoplosses are roughly always the same size
This makes my risk predictable → no need to over-adjust
Simplifies journaling and execution Why I Use Fixed Lot Size (My Context)
Focus = setups, not lot calculation

### Section: Week 4 – Page 13
Pow er of 8Traders with consistent systems → fixed lot size 
Rule: whichever method you choose, stick with it (no
switching mid-system)Which One Should You Use?

### Section: Week 4 – Page 14
Pow er of 8Calculate your average stoploss size across 20 trades
If variance is small → fixed lots may suit you
If variance is wide → % risk method is saferPractical Exercise

Pow er of 8Position Sizing Formula
Turn risk % into lot size with precision

### Section: Week 4 – Page 17
Pow er of 8Wrong lot size = wrong risk → blown account
Position size links your risk % → stoploss distance → lot size
 Why Position Sizing Matters
Professionals always size positions, never guess

### Section: Week 4 – Page 18
Pow er of 8Breaks trade into objective numbers
Adapts lot size depending on stop siz
The FormulaPosition\ Size = \frac{Account\ Balance \times Risk\ %}{Stoploss\ (pips) \times Pip\ Value}

### Section: Week 4 – Page 19
Pow er of 8Account: $10,000
Risk: 1% = $100
Stoploss: 20 pips Example (1% Risk)
Pip Value: $10 per lot
Position Size = $100 ÷ (20 × $10) = 0.5 lots

### Section: Week 4 – Page 20
Pow er of 8I use fixed lots because my stoplosses are roughly the same
Position sizing still matters — I just “pre-calculated” my fixed lot size based
on my average stops
For me → simplifies execution, journaling, and consistency My Context (Fixed Lot Style)

### Section: Week 4 – Page 21
Pow er of 8If your stoplosses vary → use formula every trade
If your stops are consistent → pre-calc your fixed lot
Whichever you choose → no switching mid-system The Rule for Students

Force accountability → no single day/week can destroy you Why Risk Limits Matter

### Section: Week 4 – Page 26
Pow er of 8Example: Max 4% per week
If hit, take rest of week off → return fresh Monday
Protects you from compounding bad weeksWeekly Risk Limit

### Section: Week 4 – Page 27
Pow er of 8Example: Max 6% per month
If hit, mandatory system review → fix mistakes
Forces reflection instead of stubborn gambling Monthly Risk Limit

### Section: Week 4 – Page 28
Rule I use:
Max 2 trades lost in a row → stop for the day
If I hit weekly cap → reset completely
Pow er of 8I risk fixed lot size, but my stop sizes are consistent → so my risk limits

### Section: Week 4 – Page 34
✅ Only increase risk when:
System proven over 100+ trades
Consistency shown for 3–6 months
Pow er of 8❌ Never scale just because you had a good weekScaling the Right Way

### Section: Week 4 – Page 35
Pow er of 8$10,000 account
Risk 1% per trade → $100
After 20% growth (account $12,000) → new risk = $120 Practical Scaling Example
Still 1% → but absolute $ grows with account

### Section: Week 4 – Page 36
Pow er of 8Personal scaling → slow but steady

Rule: scale lot sizes slowly as funding growsCompounding with Prop Capital

### Section: Week 4 – Page 37

Pow er of 8Supply & Demand Zones
Where buyers and sellers take control

### Section: Week 5 – Page 19
Pow er of 8Demand Zone (Support area) : price area where buyers step in → pushes price up
Supply Zone (Resistance area) : price area where sellers step in → pushes price down
 What Are Supply & Demand Zones?
Think of them as “wholesale” levels where the market turns

### Section: Week 5 – Page 20
Pow er of 8Found at the base of strong upward moves
Look for: clear bullish candles pushing away from a small base
 Identifying Demand Zones
Example: EUR/USD rallies after pausing → pause = demand zone

### Section: Week 5 – Page 21
Pow er of 8Found at the base of strong downward moves
Look for: clear bearish candles dropping from a small base
Example: Gold falls sharply after pause → pause = supply zone Identifying Supply Zones

### Section: Week 5 – Page 22
Pow er of 8Strong Zone: fresh, price has not retested yet → highest probability
Weak Zone: tested multiple times → less reliable
Rule: First touch is the best touchStrong vs Weak Zones

### Section: Week 5 – Page 23
Pow er of 8Identify overall trend/bias on higher timeframe
